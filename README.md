# Online Shoppers Purchase Prediction Analysis

The Objective of this project is to predict whether online shopper will purchase a product based on their web activity

## About the Data Used in the modeling:

### Description
The data is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes.
The 'Revenue' attribute is the class label.
### Summary
The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions. 
The dataset was formed so that each session
would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid
any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user
profile, or period. 

Of the 12,330 sessions in the dataset, 84.5% (10,422) were negative class samples that did not end with shopping, and the rest (1908) were positive class samples ending with shopping.
